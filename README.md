# Bank Marketing EDA – Customer Subscription Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a bank marketing dataset to understand **customer behavior** and identify **key factors influencing term deposit subscriptions**.

The analysis follows a **business question–driven approach**, simulating a real-world analytics scenario where insights are used to improve **marketing effectiveness and customer targeting**.

---

## Business Objective
To identify:
- Which customer segments are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit  
- Which campaign factors influence successful conversions  
- How banks can optimize marketing strategies using data-driven insights  

---

## Business Questions Addressed
1. What proportion of customers subscribe to a term deposit?  
2. Does customer age influence subscription behavior?  
3. Do certain job categories respond better to marketing campaigns?  
4. How does call duration impact conversion success?  
5. Does increasing the number of contact attempts improve outcomes?  

---

## Methodology
- Performed data exploration and validation (shape, data types, distributions)
- Analyzed the target variable to understand conversion rates and class imbalance
- Conducted **question-driven EDA** on customer demographics and engagement metrics
- Used appropriate visualizations for categorical and numerical features
- Translated analytical findings into **actionable business insights**

---

## Key Insights
- The overall term deposit subscription rate is **low (~11%)**, indicating inefficient mass targeting.
- **Middle-aged and older customers** show a higher likelihood of subscribing.
- **Retired and student segments** demonstrate higher subscription rates within their groups.
- **Longer call durations** are strongly associated with successful subscriptions.
- **Fewer contact attempts** lead to better outcomes, while excessive follow-ups show diminishing returns.

---

## Business Recommendations
- Focus marketing efforts on **high-response customer segments** such as retired and student groups.
- Prioritize **quality of customer interaction** over repeated contact attempts.
- Optimize call strategies by encouraging **meaningful, well-structured conversations**.
- Use demographic and engagement-based insights to design **targeted and efficient campaigns**.
