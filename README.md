# 🏦 Bank Marketing EDA – Customer Subscription Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a bank marketing dataset to understand **customer behavior** and identify **key factors influencing term deposit subscriptions**.

The analysis follows a **business question–driven approach**, simulating a real-world analytics scenario where insights are used to improve **marketing effectiveness and customer targeting**.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
To identify:
- Which customer segments are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit  
- Which campaign factors influence successful conversions  
- How banks can optimize marketing strategies using data-driven insights  

---

## ❓ Business Questions Addressed
1. What proportion of customers subscribe to a term deposit?  
2. Does customer age influence subscription behavior?  
3. Do certain job categories respond better to marketing campaigns?  
4. How does call duration impact conversion success?  
5. Does increasing the number of contact attempts improve outcomes?
